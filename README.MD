## Summary
sleeptight is a Python/Selenium WebDriver script that joins your online YTU courses for you while you are sleeping peacefully. It handles automatized leaving/joining to course meetings so that you don't have to worry about any nonattendance penalties. Please note that this is heavily WIP.

## Installation
You have to install Selenium and psutil to run sleeptight. You can use pip with requirements file:

`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

You also have to [download ChromeDriver binary](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and put it in the same directory with the sleeptight script.

## Course ID
When you run the script, it will ask for the course ID. Course ID is the 5-digit ID at the end of the URL of the Online Lesson/CanlÄ± Ders page of the course. For example if the URL is `...ViewOnlineLessonProgramForStudent/12345`, the course ID is 12345.

## Config
sleeptight creates a config file called stconfig which contains your login credentials so you don't have to enter it every time. If you entered wrong mail/password, you can delete stconfig (it will ask again for credentials and recreate stconfig) or you can edit it manually with an editor.
